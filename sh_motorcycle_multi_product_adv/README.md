About
============
If you have the number of products and selection of products at the time of making a quotation it is a quite difficult task. So don't worry we have a solution here we build a module that can help to find a particular product from the product list. In this module provide a button "Select Product Advance" in the sale order. You can find auto parts in the product using a filter like a type, make, model, year. Also, you can find the product using the product attribute field. You can find a product by comparing price, barcode, internal reference. sometimes some product is commonly required so you can add product in 'specific' list and you can add that product in the quotation. This module saves your important time and reduces human error as well as less effort.
