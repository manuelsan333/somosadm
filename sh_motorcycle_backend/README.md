About
============
In automobile shops have numerous auto parts there is no count for parts and it's variants that's the way it is quite difficult to manage into the shop. So that's why we created a model that will help you to manage it. This module will help to manage an auto part by make, model, year, type. You can also assign vehicles in auto parts product variants so it will become very easy to find the product using vehicle details. In this module provide two groups for user and manager so you can easily apply access rights for user and manager. This is very clean and transparent so the user can easily understand how it works.
